# AssetFlow Backend

This directory contains backend-related code for the AssetFlow application.

## Structure

- `api/`: Contains API endpoints and route handlers
- `models/`: Data models and schemas
- `services/`: Business logic and service layer
- `utils/`: Utility functions for the backend
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
- `config/`: Configuration files

## Getting Started

To implement a full backend, you can:

1. Set up a Node.js/Express server
2. Connect to a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or use a BaaS like Supabase or Firebase
3. Implement authentication using JWT, Auth0, or other auth providers
4. Create API endpoints for your frontend to consume

For now, this structure serves as a placeholder for your backend implementation.
